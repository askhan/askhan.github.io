        <ol>
            <li>Everything is a system: Each system is perfectly designed to achieve its current results. To get different results, you simply need to change some part of the system.</li>
            <li>Make your thinking visible: If you can't explain it as a process, then you don't really understand it. Draw out your ideas on paper or a whiteboard. This helps make your thinking clearer.</li>
            <li>Start where you are and experiment: Begin with what you know and have right now. Try different things—doing stuff gives you new information. Stay curious. Have fun. Enjoy the journey.</li>
